On selecting python data visualisation libraries, we are researching some of the libraries: Matplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn, ggplot, bokeh, pygal, and Plotly. Among of numerous data visualisation libraries mentioned, we chose Matplotlib and Plotly. We chose Matplotlib because Matplotlib is actually the "baseline" of the other libraries (e.g. Pandas, Seaborn, ggplot etc.). The main advantage of implementing Matplotlib is the simplicity it offered (no required other visualization libraries as dependencies) and modest learning curve. While the disadvantage is the visualization on Matplotlib might seems not as visually appealing as the other libraries while still served the purpose of visualizing data. To complement with that, we chose Plotly which is a library that is generally new compares to the others. Plotly benefited with online rich and interactive data visualization tools, the drawbacks of implementing it is the complexity of setting the API and the data visualization will be posted on the web. In short, we are more interested to implement these two libraries rather than the others mainly because the Matplotlib offered data visualization that already serves the purpose without much complexity needed and interactive data visualization that Plotly offered that we believe outperform the other libraries. 

Based of the data that we gathered from the senseHat, bargraph and linegraph visualize the time series data better than other graphs. On the linegraph, we visualize the actual temp and humid with the constraints in config.json in order to identify the data is within the limit, which visualized by using Matplotlib. While on the bargraph, we visualize the minimum, average, maximum of temperature and humidity per day, which visualized by using Plotly.
